## 📝 Description

AI Model Manager, it's like pip or npm - but for AI models!

#### User Benefits 
* Save disk space, potentially many gigabytes 
* No more having to hunt for a model and making sure you rename it and put it in the correct folder
* Less effort needed to audit what models are installed and where they came from 

#### Developer Benefits
* Less code to manage, no longer need to handle keeping model list and download logic
* Pickle scaning and security mechanisms will be built into app

## 📦 Installation

Visit [AI Models](https://aimodels.org) and select and install the version right for you. (This is still pre-release alpha)

## 💻 Quickstart

First we have to initialize the aimodels.json file in the local folder

```bash
aimm init
```

Search for a model you want to use. For example the BSRGAN model, a super resolution model that can upscale images.

```bash
aimm search BSRGAN
```

Then we install and add it to a local aimodels.json file to keep track of all the models you use in your project.

```bash
aimm add BSRGAN
```

## 👩‍💻 GUI

The GUI is developed but not ready for release yet.

This will allow modules such as stable horde to be integrated.
