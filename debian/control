Description: AI Model Manager
 AI Model Manager CLI, it's like pip or npm - but for AI models!
 .
 For users, this allows easily managing your collection of AI models. It stores
 your models in a location that all of your AI enabled apps can access, so you
 don't need to worry about the huge files taking up so much space, or creating
 symlinks. Finally, no more having to hunt for a model and making sure you
 rename it and put it in the correct folder correctly.
 .
 For developers, it means less code that you have to handle initializing your
 app and collecting all of the AI model resources needed. AI Model Manager also
 will provide security through checksum checks and pickle scanning.
